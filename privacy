Face Data Collection and Use

Our app collects a face recognition template of your face when you use certain features. This data is used to calculate the similarity between your face and the enrolled database, which determines the recognized face.

We use this data solely for the purpose of providing you with a secure and accurate authentication process. We do not use this data for any other purposes, and we do not share it with any third parties.

The face data is only stored in our app's internal database.

We take the security and privacy of your face data seriously and use industry-standard security measures to protect it from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction
